Custom Escalators - Made by Noneatme

If you want to create custom escalators, press your F2 key on your keyboard.
(Make sure that you are allowed to create custom escalators by checking the "enable_designer" variable in the Main.lua file. (It must be true))
	
Key shortcuts:
    F - Enable/Disable mouse/fly mode
    DEL - Delete selected escalator
    
To create a escalator, click on the upper left corner icon. You can click then on 2 world positions with your mouse, and your escalator is done.
To modify the selected escalator, click on a specific icon on your left side.

To output the escalators, click on the 'Output escalator' icon on the right side. 
Verify that the escalator resource is started, if you want to add custom escalators to your own gamemode/resource.

Be carefull: Many escalators can slow your system down.
Escalators can only created client-side. The designer is not synchronized with other clients.
It's recommended that you should create escalators in other resources.
This is a very early version. Please report bugs to Noneatme@hotmail.de.
